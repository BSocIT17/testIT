<h1><strong>Styling</strong></h1> 

<h1><span style="color: red;"><strong>Colours</strong></span></h1>

<h1><font size="24">Font Size</font></h1>

<h1><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Font Families</span></h1>

<p>CSS, or <strong>C</strong>ascading <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heets, is a simple language which describes how HTML elements are displayed.</p>

<p style = "color: green"> It can be added in three different ways </p>

<p style = "color: brown; font-size: 34"> Inline Style or Internal or External</p>


<p style = "color: blue; font-size 28"> Inline style is exactly what it is! Right now, we are using inline style. Here's a sample of what this line looks like.</p>

<p> < p>style = "color: blue; font-size 28"> Inline style is exactly what it is! < /p> (remove the spaces) </p>

<p style = "color: green; font-size 12"> Do it! Just do it! Don't let your dreams be dreams. Yesterday, you said tomorrow. So just do it! Make your dreams come true! Just do it! Some people dream of success, while you're gonna wake up and work hard at it! Nothing is impossible! You should get to the point where anyone else would quit, and you're not gonna stop there! No, what are you waiting for? Do it! Just do it! Yes you can! Just do it.
If you're tired of starting over, stop giving up! </p>

<p> Inline styling is great, simple and easy to distinguish in code. Though things can get cluttered if you start displaying things with multiple properties. </p>


<div style="position:relative;height:220px;margin-top:50px;">

 <h1>CSS = Styles and Colors</h1>
 <div style="letter-spacing:12px;font-size:15px;position:relative;left:25px;top:10px;">Manipulate Text</div>
 <div style="color:#40B3DF;letter-spacing:12px;font-size:15px;position:relative;left:25px;top:20px;">Colors,
 <span style="background-color:#B4009E;color:#ffffff;">&nbsp;Boxes</span></div>
 </div>

<h3> Internal Styling simplifies things by combining all styles into a separate section in the code </h3>

<p> It could look something like this: <p>

<p>Essentially instead of having your inline styling, it is grouped together into something elegant like this! </p>


<style>
body {background-color: white;}
h2   {color: white;}
p2   {color: purple;}
.red-text {color: red;font-size: 16;}
</style>
</head>


<h2>This is a heading</h2>
<p2>This is a paragraph.</p2>
<p class = "red-text"> This paragraph is using the pre-defined class 'red-text'>
